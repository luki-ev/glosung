Installation instruction
========================

To install glosung you basically have to:

scons install

This will install glosung und /usr.  If you prefer to install under a
different directory for example /usr/local try:

scons PREFIX=/usr/local install

For package maintainers to install in a different location, e.g. a
sandbox environment, use DESTDIR option:

scons DESTDIR=`pwd`/tmp

It is also possible to combine both options.
