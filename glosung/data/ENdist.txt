Distribution - how to
=====================

Some points a distributor of the Watchwords disk should consider:

  * check the disk for viruses!

  * set the disk label (LABEL command under DOS). This is especially
    important when you are re-using disks. Recommended label: LOSUNG00

  * the disk should look neat (e.g. use a printed label). In the download
    area of the internet pages you'll find a label for printing.

  * print your own address on the label (at least your phone number)

  * print the internet address on the label (www.losung.de)

Reasons for the new distribution structure
------------------------------------------

In 1999, we'd like to establish a new distribution structure in order to
spread the load more evenly. There are various reasons for this:

  * During past years, more and more people contacted Reinhold Willnat
    [the originator of the Watchwords programs] for the new disk.

  * There are currently several program versions for various languages
    and operating systems.

  * Maintaining a list of the main distributors alone, and shipping the
    disks to them, is a tremendous amount of work!

To solve these problems, the Watchwords disk (DOS/Windows) will, from now
on, be distributed by the "snowball system." This involves several
clearly distinguished tasks.

In Germany, where lots of disks have been distributed during the past
years, this system starts in 1998. For other countries, this is a
proposal that should turn out to be helpful, too.

See also the list of distributors in various countries of the world.

The distribution structure of the DOS/Windows disk
--------------------------------------------------

In principle, all distributors should be able to give an e-mail address.
This helps a lot in communication!

The local distributor:

        * takes over responsibility for the distribution in one
          community.

        * end users should direct all requests for a new Watchwords disk
          to their local distributor!

        * There is no limit for the creativity of local distributors:
          distribute the disk amongst your friends and relatives, in your
          Church, Bible Study Group, etc... We'd like to publish your
          best ideas on the internet (please send these by e-mail to the
          language coordinator).

        * A local distributor does not discriminate against any
          denomination but observes 1 Tim. 2:4 ...

            God wants everyone to be saved and to know the truth.

The regional distributor:

        * there is one regional distributor for each main zip code
          division (perhaps the first two digits of a given zip code -
          various countries may want to experiment as to what makes most
          sense for them).

        * The regional distributor passes the programs along to the local
          distributors in his region (or just informs them via e-mail
          -for those who have e-mail capabilities-).

        * He thinks of ways how he can distribute the programs in his
          region to more communities. Cultivating a number of local
          distributors will help him, on the basis of the snowball
          system, to accomplish that task.

        * He maintains a list of local distributors in his region (in
          order to forward questions of end users to the local
          distributors, etc.).

        * If a regional distributor begins or terminates his
          participation, or if his address changes, he informs the
          national distributor (to keep the address list up to date!).

The main distributor:

        * one for each starting digit of a zip code (various countries
          may want to experiment as to what makes most sense for them).

        * For a main distributor, e-mail capabilities and internet access
          are required!

        * The main distributor obtains the Watchwords programs from the
          internet as soon as they are released and forwards them to the
          regional distributors in his region.

        * Each main distributor is willing to handle your e-mail
          requests.

The national distributor:

        * coordinates the distribution in a given country (e.g. USA)

        * in countries with more than one main language, all distributors
          should distribute the main language versions of the Watchwords
          programs equally (provided these exist). The national
          distributor should also be able to obtain versions in other
          languages upon request.

        * For the German language, national distributors in Germany,
          Austria and Switzerland are at work.

        * For English, there could be national distributors for the USA,
          Great Britain, and many other countries ...

        * The national distributor maintains a list of main distributors,
          regional distributors, and of other special distributors in his
          country. All address changes of sub-distributors should be
          directed to the national distributor.

        * The national distributor forwards this list to the language
          coordinators of the language versions distributed in that
          country.

The language coordinator:

        * maintains the lines you are now reading for his language

        * coordinates the work of the national distributors for his
          language

        * for German, this is Helmut Steeb in 1999

        * for English, this is Roland Freischlad in 1999.
