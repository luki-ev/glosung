The freeware Watchwords programs http://www.losung.de
Email: info@losung.de

Introduction 

What?
The Watchwords (German "Losungen") of the Moravian Church
(http://www.ebu.de), well-known in many lands in booklet form, daily
feature a word of the Old Testament chosen by lot and a suitable word
of the New Testament. These bible words are available for computers
also: over the web and for the operating systems DOS, Windows, Linux
and some others, in various languages. The programs are free of charge
(!) and can be used as a text display program, and, for some operating
systems, as a screen saver. In this way you can be reminded of the
words of Scripture as you work with your computer, as well as
incorporate these texts into a document (a letter, for example).

God may use the watchwords to speak to us: he comforts or corrects us
and makes us thankful. The watchwords are not an oracle having the
right advice for every situation. The watchwords are helpful because
they are bible words. They cannot replace the bible. Reading the
watchwords unites Christians all over the world. But the true union of
Christians is in Christ - including Christians who do not read the
watchwords.

Who?
We are not the Moravian Church. We are engaged individual Christians
who get the watchwords from the Moravian Church by license. We create
various computer programs, translate watchwords texts, integrate and
distribute them. 

When?
The program packages contain the watchwords texts for one year. The
packages for the year to come are available in December.

What's for English?
To link to the English language pages directly, use the link
http://www.losung.de/en/. The English download page contains the
programs just for English. In the pages for other languages (to be
accessed via the start page) you'll find programs for these languages,
translations of the information texts and maybe special information
for the respective language.

Dear friends of the Watchwords,

Hard-working people, giving glory to our great God, have very joyfully
contributed their part, in making an idea born in 1988, into what you
now have before you: the freeware Watchwords! I wish you a successful
installation of your Watchwords program. May God bless you in
considering His Word throughout the year!

First of all I give thanks to the

  * "Evangelische Brüder-Unität" (another name for the
    Moravian Church), Herrnhut and Bad Boll (Germany,
    http://www.ebu.de), as well as to the
    
  * publisher "Reinhardt Verlag" (http://www.reinhardt.ch)
    
for granting a license to distribute the Watchwords texts in this form
on disk, via mailboxes (bulletin boards), and via the internet.

Copying and distributing the Watchwords programs and their data files
freely, is a beautiful service to God. Any commercial usage is
expressly prohibited.

Regarding legal matters, please read the license agreement.

I will make every effort to continue publishing the Watchwords for
each year to come, and I will be glad to hear from you, the user.

Thus far I have received many encouraging letters from Germany and
abroad (USA, Brazil, Lima, Iraq, Istanbul, China, New Guinea, South
Africa, Uganda, Rumania, New Zealand, Indonesia, Australia, Israel,
etc.).

May the Living God bless each individual.

I am grateful for the distribution circles of various computer systems
that have formed thus far. Copying and shipping so many diskettes by
now exceed my time and resources. Therefore, please request the
Watchwords diskettes from a distributor near you, and also help to
distribute these to your friends. In this manner, the Watchwords
diskettes get to their destination much faster. Please read the
description of the distribution structure.

Near the end of the year, many ask about what time the new programs
will be available. Up to 25 such requests per day are too many for me,
however! I am sure you will understand that I will hardly be able to
answer such requests in the future. I would rather spend my time on
getting the ever expanding Watchwords program ready in time. - And I
also need to devote time to my regular profession...

In case you have questions about the programs, please address these to
the respective programmers directly.

Finally, I want to share a prayer request: please 

  * pray that the Word of God through the Watchwords will reach many
    people and become a blessing to them. 
    
  * give thanks that the license for distributing the watch words in
    this form has been extended to the year 2004.
    
Creating these Watchwords programs, preparing them for distribution
and for the internet, requires considerable effort in time and money.
Distributing the disks and CDs at exhibitions and trade shows free of
charge is expensive, and involves high fees for space rental.

In agreement with the licensees, the following account is listed for
donations benefiting the distribution of free Christian software:

Account Holder:
Reinhold Willnat
Bismarckstraße 113 
D-47057 Duisburg 
Phone: +49 (0203) 93 60 23 
Fax: +49 (0203) 93 60 24 

Deutsche Bank 
Account #: 4 99 66 33 
Bank Routing #: 350 700 24

I also give sincere thanks to the authors of the programs who, with
great effort, provided these excellent programs freely. 

Time and again I wonder: why do so many people assist voluntarily and
with pleasure in this work?

I believe the Watchwords ministry is something which God Himself holds
firmly in his hands, it being "the business of the Chief Executive."
He calls the necessary workers and gives them joy in supporting this
work.

To God be the glory!

                           Reinhold Willnat

Could you distribute the Watchwords disk (DOS/Windows) in your
community? 

Great! Please inform the regional distributor of your zip code. He
will from then on send you the new Watchwords disk as soon as it is
ready (in case you can access the internet, he will simply tell you
where to download it).

There are many communities that do not yet have the Watchwords disk.
Who hears God's call to participate in this ministry?

Watchwords there?

Please ask that person and direct him/her to the regional distributor!

other computer system)?
